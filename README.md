# Lecture notes for Simber coding workshop

## Lecture: Introduction to the cardiac MPS database and analysis package

## Practical: Code design underlying the MPS package and modifying it to your use case

## Building the slides

Slides are built with [`marpit`](https://marpit.marp.app). This is a tool for converting markdown to html.
To build the slides you need to first install `marp` with `yarn` or `npm`, see <https://marpit.marp.app/?id=installation>.

Then you should be able to run
```
marp lecture.md
```
and it will create a new file called `lecture.html` containing the slides.
